## üì∞ News
[2023.3 ] This work has been accepted by CVPR 2023.\
[2023.3 ] The experiments and code on SQR-Deformable DETR have been released.\
[2022.12] The experiments and code on SQR-Adamixer have been released.\
[2022.12] The code is available now. 

## ü§î Motivation
### üåß One phenomenon where query-based object detectors mispredict at the last decoding stage but correctly predict at intermediate stages.

The decoding procedure of DETR implies that detection should be stage-by-stage enhanced in terms of IOU and confidence score. Indeed, monotonically improved AP is empirically achieved by this procedure. However, when visualizing the stage-wise predictions, we surprisingly observe that decoder makes mistakes in a decent proportion of cases where the later stages degrade true- positives and upgrade false-positives from the former stages.

### ‚≠ï Two limitations of training 
1. The responsibility that each stage takes is unbalanced, while supervision applied to them is analogous.  
2.  Due to the sequential structure of the decoder, an intermediate query refined by a stage - no matter this refinement brings positive or negative effects - will be cascaded to the following stage

## üöÄ Selective Query Recollection
As a training strategy that fit most query-based object detectors (DETR family), SQR cumulatively collects intermediate queries as stages go deeper, and feeds the collected queries to the downstream stages aside from the sequential structure.



## ‚û°Ô∏è Guide to Code

This repo provide the implementation of SQR-Adamixer and SQR-deformable DETR. [Adamixer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16507) is a typical query-based object detector that enjoys fast convergence and high AP performance. 
[Deformable DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04159) is known for its creative deformable attention module that mitigates the slow convergence and high complexity issues of DETR.

The code structure follows the MMDetection framework. To get started, please refer to mmdetection doc [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for installation.

Our config file lies in [configs/sqr](configs/sqr) folder. 

### SQR-Adamixer
We provide two implementation instances of SQR-adamixer in this repo, one is in [/mmdet/models/roi_heads/adamixer_decoder_Qrecycle.py](/mmdet/models/roi_heads/adamixer_decoder_Qrecycle.py), which might be slower for training but require less GPU memory (and easy to understand the logic). Another is in [/mmdet/models/roi_heads/adamixer_decoder_Qrecycle_optimize.py](/mmdet/models/roi_heads/adamixer_decoder_Qrecycle_optimize.py), which is much faster than the former but has higher requirement on GPU memory. 

### SQR-Deformable DETR
We provide the implementation of SQR-deformable DETR in `QRDeformableDetrTransformerDecoder` in [/mmdet/models/utils/transformer.py](/mmdet/models/utils/transformer.py). Note Deformable DETR requires 32 as training batchsize and we follow this setting.

__NOTE:__
Please use `mmcv_full==1.3.3` and `pytorch>=1.5.0` for correct reproduction.

## Introduction

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README_zh-CN.md)

MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.3+**.
The old v1.x branch works with PyTorch 1.1 to 1.4, but v2.0 is strongly recommended for faster speed, higher performance, better design and more friendly usage.

### Major features

- **Modular Design**

  We decompose the detection framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized object detection framework by combining different modules.

- **Support of multiple frameworks out of box**

  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary detection frameworks, *e.g.* Faster RCNN, Mask RCNN, RetinaNet, etc.

- **High efficiency**

  All basic bbox and mask operations run on GPUs. The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases, including [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark) and [SimpleDet](https://github.com/TuSimple/simpledet).

- **State of the art**

  The toolbox stems from the codebase developed by the *MMDet* team, who won [COCO Detection Challenge](http://cocodataset.org/#detection-leaderboard) in 2018, and we keep pushing it forward.

Apart from MMDetection, we also released a library [mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv) for computer vision research, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.

## License

The mmdetection project is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Changelog

v2.12.0 was released in 01/05/2021.
Please refer to [changelog.md](docs/changelog.md) for details and release history.
A comparison between v1.x and v2.0 codebases can be found in [compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md).
